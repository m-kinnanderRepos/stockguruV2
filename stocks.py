# I could keep this funcionality as is. But there are some options
#   1) I could keep as is and in function above, manipulate data as the high and low are averages from
#       the data of the three calls.
#   2) I could redo everything. Make the first call of three weeks ago be some decision and 
#       print out if three is not above 45 and keep going if it is to 5 days ago.
#   3) I could make the api call reusable to take in certain day. So I would keep calling get_data
#       with 21 days then 5 then 30. Then decision making between all three calls when necessary.

# If current time is when Stock exchange is open, call today. 

# Could do 28, 14, then today.


# Add day to Advice. 


# Get the data for all three days (28, 14, and today).
# Do advice from the three sets.
#   1) If 28 isn't above 45% than saw so plus is 14 days above 45%?
#   2) If 28 Is above 45%, then is 14?
#   3) If 28 and 14 are above 45%, then buy.
